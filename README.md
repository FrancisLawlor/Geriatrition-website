# Geriatrition-website

Designed as part of a Web Design module during my first year in university, this website aims to promote the availability of a fictional fitness service provided to over 65s.

Although at the time my programming experience was relatively limited, I did attempt to compensate by making careful decisions regarding HCI, target demographic, site metaphor etc. and by designing certain visual components myself e.g. buttons.
