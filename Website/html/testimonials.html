								I was interested in going to the gym but at 67 I was worried it might be a stressful environment for me. My daughter told me about GERIATRITION who were starting up a Zumba course for people my age in the gym nearby. It sounded like it was a great idea but I was still concerned that it might be too difficult or that the instructors might be impatient with me. The first session was free so I thought I’d give it a go for the first week at least and that way I’d have nothing to lose. It turned out to be very enjoyable and I signed up straight away!

								My friends were raving about GERIATRITION and I decided to go along with them one week to see what all the fuss was about. I wasn’t the most active person and I wasn’t expecting to have a good time. But I ended up loving it. The coaches were encouraging and helpful. The other people doing the class were lovely. I go with my friends any chance I get now. And I’ve lost weight too!

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								After a few months of illness I became very weak without exercise. I needed to build up my strength again, surrounded by people who knew what my limits were. My doctor suggested GERIATRITION. I went along for the free session and the instructors were all so helpful. GERIATRITION played a key role in my recovery and also in helping me to feel better than I have in years.
